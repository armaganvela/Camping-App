# Camp-App
I showed the react template i use in the my web projects. I used Token Based Authentication to make clients authorized. When started the react app, it is met with Login Page. I added new identity user in seed method in ASP.NET API. You can replace it with what you want identity user. After making update-database, you can login the app the user name and password you choosed. I am developing the project to support the software camps made in the world. Admin can enter camp name, talking, speakers, country and address informations for now.
